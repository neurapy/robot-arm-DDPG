## Introduction

This project is the second one in Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree. The task was to train an agent to control a robot arm, and keep it in a moving target area.

In the environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the agent's goal is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Agent

To solve this Enviroment a DDPG was used.

The Actor & Critic each have 2 hidden with 128 Units.
